# inSituFocus introduction
InSituFocus, an interactive visualization software for in situ sequencing, supports visualizing DAPI/HE images, gene transcript signal points, cells, and cell dimensionality reduction maps of tissues. InSituFocus enables visualization of tissues with massive signal points and cells. InSituFocus supports selection of regions with any shape, enabling cell/signal point counting, area/perimeter statistics, and generation of gene expression histograms for regions. InSituFocus allows users to freely choose the size of spots and then cluster spots based on the transcript signal point counts of gene expression, quickly generate cluster regions.
